# Keyboard Builder for eScriptorium ‚å®Ô∏è
This browser app lets you build **virtual keyboards** for [eScriptorium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EScriptorium) with ease.<br><br>It's also useful if you want to transition from another transcription client with an already existing virtual keyboard, without having to manually add all your custom Unicode characters again (*which is a drag!*).

**Features**:
* `Junicode2` as standard font for displaying a wide range of Unicodes. [‚Üó Junicode Font by Peter S. Baker](https://psb1558.github.io/Junicode-font/)
* `Filter` by Unicode categories (e.g. `Greek and Coptic`, `Hebrew`, `Latin Extended-A` ...) for easier access to the Unicode range you have in mind
* `Search` for a specific Unicode by name (e.g. `"Greek Capital Letter Omega"`). You don't have to memorize the complete name, a part is enough (e.g. `Greek Cap`) ... 
* `Paste` a **single** Unicode character you copied elsewhere and add it to your keyboard
* `Paste` a **string** of Unicode characters (e.g. `¬£q¬´¬±¬≤≈øƒì‚àì‚ÜÑ`) and add each individual character to your keyboard automatically
* Adjust the `order` of your keyboard via **drag** and **drop**
* Adjust the `layout` of your keyboard by increasing or decreasing the  column / row count of your grid (i.e. you can design a keyboard layout in a `2 x 10` grid or `4 x 5` and so forth...)
* `Download` your keyboard as an eScriptorium compatible `.json` file

### Import an existing virtual keyboard 
If you want to import an already existing virtual keyboard (e.g. in *Transkribus*) to eScriptorium you can use the Keyboard Builder like this: 

1. Simply paste all Unicodes of your existing keyboard in a new Transkribus document without any whitespaces between them.
2. Copy the resulting string (e.g. `¬£q¬´¬±¬≤≈ø≈ìƒì‚àì‚ÜÑ`) 
3. Paste this string to the "Paste character(s) here" field of the Keyboard Builder.
4. Click on the "Add Character(s)" button and every single unique character of the string will be added to your custom keyboard.
